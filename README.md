LinkedList
==========

My own ANSI C LinkedList implementation

I created this not because it is particularly good or particularly innovative,
but because I couldn't find an already existing one that:

1- Was neatly written
2- Was generic enough
3- Had a license compatible with my use case

I almost used tomelm's implementation
(https://github.com/tomelm/C-Doubly-Linked-List) which satisfies 1 and 2, but
not 3 (there is no license and its a homework, so the copyright is possibly
owned by the school).

So I whipped out my own and am making it MIT licensed since it's so basic
there's probably a better implementation elsewhere anyway.
